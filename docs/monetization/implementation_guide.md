## Technical Implementation

### Authentication and Authorization System

**Recommendation**: Implement OAuth-based authentication with JWT tokens.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create a user authentication service with:
   - Email/password authentication
   - Social login options (GitHub, Google)
   - JWT token issuing and validation
2. Add CLI authentication command:
   ```
   autoswe login
   ```
3. Store authentication tokens securely:
   - macOS: Keychain
   - Windows: Credential Manager
   - Linux: Secret Service API

**Feature Gating Approach**:
1. Define feature flags for each tier in a central configuration
2. Implement server-side validation of entitlements
3. Create graceful degradation for unauthorized feature attempts

### Subscription Management

**Recommendation**: Use Stripe for subscription management and billing.

**Key Components**:
1. Stripe Products and Prices for each tier
2. Webhook integration for subscription events
3. Customer portal for self-service subscription management
4. Proration handling for upgrades/downgrades

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create Stripe product catalog matching your pricing tiers
2. Implement subscription creation flow
3. Build webhook handler for subscription events
4. Develop admin dashboard for subscription management

### Usage Tracking and Limits

**Recommendation**: Implement a metering service for tracking and limiting AI interactions.

**Architecture**:
1. Central metering service that logs all AI interactions
2. Redis or similar for high-performance counters
3. Periodic aggregation of usage data to persistent storage
4. Real-time limit checking before processing requests

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add usage tracking middleware to API endpoints
2. Create usage dashboard for customers
3. Implement graceful handling of limit-reached scenarios
4. Build admin reporting for usage patterns

## User Experience Considerations

### Onboarding Flow

**Recommended Process**:
1. Simple installation (`npm install -g autoswe` or equivalent)
2. Interactive setup wizard (`autoswe init`)
3. Guided first use experience
4. Clear indication of tier-specific features

**Key UX Elements**:
- Minimize friction in getting started (free tier)
- Clear visibility of available features vs. premium features
- Non-disruptive upgrade prompts when attempting premium features
- Transparent usage counters (`autoswe status`)

### Upgrade Experience

**Design Principles**:
1. Make upgrade paths obvious but not intrusive
2. Provide a seamless web-based upgrade flow
3. Instant access to new features after upgrade
4. Clear confirmation of tier changes

**Implementation**:
- Command for upgrading: `autoswe upgrade`
- Web-based checkout flow with seamless return to CLI
- Immediate feature unlocking after subscription

### Communication of Limits

**Best Practices**:
1. Proactive notification when approaching limits (80% threshold)
2. Clear error messages when limits are reached
3. Immediate suggestions for appropriate upgrade paths
4. Usage dashboard accessible via CLI (`autoswe usage`)

## Business Operations Setup

### Payment Processing

**Recommendation**: Stripe for payment processing with backup gateway option.

**Setup Requirements**:
1. Stripe account and API configuration
2. Tax handling (consider Stripe Tax)
3. Currency support based on target markets
4. PCI compliance considerations

### Customer Support System

**Recommendation**: Tiered support system based on subscription level.

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Select helpdesk system (Zendesk, Intercom, or similar)
2. Define SLAs for each subscription tier
3. Create self-service knowledge base
4. Train support team on product specifics

### Legal Requirements

**Necessary Documents**:
1. Terms of Service
2. Privacy Policy
3. Subscription Agreement
4. Data Processing Agreement (for enterprise customers)

**Regulatory Considerations**:
- GDPR compliance for EU customers
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Data sovereignty options for enterprise tier
- License terms for embedded third-party technologies

## Go-to-Market Strategy
