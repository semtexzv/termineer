# Project-Specific Name Recommendations for Multi-LLM Console Interface

## Project Understanding

After reviewing the README, I now have a clear understanding of the project:

- **Current Name**: AutoSWE (likely "Automated Software Engineering")
- **Actual Function**: A command-line interface for interacting with multiple AI models (Claude, Gemini, OpenRouter)
- **Key Features**: 
  - Interactive console conversations
  - Single query mode for scripting
  - Ability to switch between different models
  - Advanced tool capabilities (web content summarization)
  - System prompts and conversation history

This understanding allows for more targeted and appropriate naming recommendations.

| Multimind | Multiple + Mind | Indicates access to multiple AI "minds" |
| Modex | Model + Exchange | Suggests switching between models |
| Aiswitch | AI + Switch | Directly describes model switching feature |

### 3. Connector/Bridge Concepts

Names that emphasize connecting to multiple AI services:

| Name | Concept | Strengths |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Nexai | Nexus + AI | Suggests central connection point for AIs |
| Aibrid | AI + Bridge | Indicates bridging to multiple AI models |
| Condai | Conduit + AI | Suggests channel to AI models |
| Linkage | Link + Age | Suggests connecting to the AI age |
| Ailink | AI + Link | Direct description of connecting to AI |
| Bridgai | Bridge + AI | Indicates bridging to AI models |

## Evaluation of Top Candidates

Let's evaluate the most promising options against our criteria:

### 1. Omniai

- **Overall**: Excellent balance of terminal reference and brevity

### 3. Nexai

- **Concept**: Nexus + AI - suggesting a central connection point for multiple AIs
- **Memorability**: ★★★★☆ - Distinctive and meaningful
- **Typability**: ★★★★☆ - Easy to type
- **Relevance**: ★★★★★ - Communicates connection to multiple models
- **CLI Suitability**: ★★★★☆ - Works well as command (`nexai query "..."`)
- **Uniqueness**: ★★★★☆ - Distinctive in CLI space
- **Overall**: Strong metaphor for connecting to multiple AI services

### 4. Clide

- **Concept**: CLI + Guide - suggesting a command-line guide/assistant
- **Memorability**: ★★★★★ - Short, distinctive, easy to remember
- **Typability**: ★★★★★ - Extremely easy to type
- **Relevance**: ★★★★☆ - Directly references CLI nature
- **CLI Suitability**: ★★★★★ - Perfect as command (`clide query "..."`)
- **Uniqueness**: ★★★★★ - Highly distinctive
- **Overall**: Elegant, simple, perfect for a CLI tool

### 5. Modex

- **Concept**: Model + Exchange - suggesting switching between models
- **Memorability**: ★★★★☆ - Short, distinctive
- **Typability**: ★★★★★ - Very easy to type
- **Relevance**: ★★★★★ - Directly describes model exchange functionality
- **CLI Suitability**: ★★★★★ - Excellent as command (`modex query "..."`)
- **Uniqueness**: ★★★★☆ - Distinctive in CLI space
- **Overall**: Directly communicates the model-switching capability

## Validation Check

Let's validate these top candidates for potential conflicts:

1. **Omniai**: Limited existing usage in tech space
2. **Termini**: Some usage (terminal-related tools), but not overwhelming
3. **Nexai**: Some AI projects, but not a major CLI tool
4. **Clide**: Few conflicts found, appears relatively available
5. **Modex**: Used in some contexts, but not as an AI model interface

## Final Recommendations

Based on project-specific evaluation, these three names are most appropriate:

### 1. Clide

**Strengths**:
- Perfect for a CLI tool (CLI + Guide)
- Extremely easy to type and remember
- Suggests guidance/assistance (core function of the tool)
- Highly distinctive with few conflicts
- Works perfectly as a command

**Example Usage**:
```bash
clide "What is the capital of France?"
clide --model claude-3-opus "Explain quantum computing"
```

### 2. Omniai

**Strengths**:
- Directly communicates the multi-model nature
- Suggests access to "all AIs" (omni = all)
- Distinctive yet intuitive
- Works well as a command
- Clearly AI-focused

**Example Usage**:
```bash
omniai "What is the capital of France?"
omniai --model gemini-1.5-pro "Explain quantum computing"
```

### 3. Modex

**Strengths**:
- Directly suggests model exchange/switching (core feature)
- Very easy to type
- Short and memorable
- Works excellently as a command
- Technical but approachable

**Example Usage**:
```bash
modex "What is the capital of France?"
modex --model openrouter/gpt-4o "Explain quantum computing"
```

## Conclusion

For a multi-LLM console interface, a name that communicates either the CLI nature or the multi-model switching capability is most appropriate. **Clide** stands out as the strongest candidate due to its simplicity, relevance to CLI functionality, and distinctiveness. Both **Omniai** and **Modex** are excellent alternatives that emphasize different aspects of the tool's functionality.

These recommendations better align with the actual purpose of the project than our previous suggestions, which were made without understanding the specific nature of the tool.
