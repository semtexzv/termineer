# Final Name Recommendation: Shellgent

## Executive Summary

After extensive research into naming strategies for AI coding tools and CLI applications, with a particular focus on terms related to agents, terminals, coding, and AI, **Shellgent** emerges as the strongest recommendation for the multi-LLM console interface.

This name has been validated to have no existing conflicts in the software space, perfectly communicates the tool's function, and works effectively as a CLI command.

## Key Findings from Validation

Through our validation process, we discovered:

1. **Shellgent** - No existing software products or tools found with this name
2. **Proxsh** - Minimal conflicts (primarily a personal name)
3. **Termiq** - No direct software tool conflicts
4. **Promptix** - Some similarity to existing "Promptrix" tool which could cause confusion

## Why Shellgent Is the Ideal Choice

### 1. Perfect Conceptual Fit

The name **Shellgent** combines "Shell" (command-line environment) with "Agent/Intelligent" to create a name that directly communicates the tool's purpose - an intelligent agent that operates in a shell environment.

This perfectly describes the multi-LLM console interface that allows users to interact with various AI models through a command-line interface.

### 2. Complete Uniqueness

Our validation search found no existing software tools, products, or significant online presence using the name "Shellgent," making it completely available for this project.

### 3. CLI Command Effectiveness

The name works naturally as a command-line command:

```bash
shellgent "Explain quantum computing"
shellgent --model claude-3-opus "What are the benefits of Rust?"
shellgent --system "You are a helpful assistant" "How do I optimize my code?"
```

The command flows well and is easy to remember, while not being too lengthy to type.

### 4. Strong Branding Potential

The name offers excellent branding opportunities:

- **Visual identity**: Can combine shell/terminal imagery with intelligent agent concepts
- **Tagline options**:
  - "Your intelligent shell companion"
  - "AI agents at your command"
  - "Command line, amplified intelligence"

### 5. Domain Availability

The following domains appear to be available:
- shellgent.dev (ideal for developer tools)
- shellgent.io (popular for developer platforms)
- getshellgent.com (common pattern for products)

## Alternative Recommendations

If "Shellgent" encounters any unforeseen issues, these alternatives also showed strong potential:

### 1. Proxsh

- **Concept**: Proxy + Shell - shell proxy to multiple AIs
- **Strengths**: Extremely short, minimal conflicts, easy to type
- **Validation**: Very minimal existing presence online

### 2. Termiq

- **Concept**: Terminal + IQ - terminal with intelligence
- **Strengths**: Short, intuitive, directly communicates "intelligent terminal"
- **Validation**: No direct software tool conflicts

## Implementation Plan

To proceed with the "Shellgent" name, we recommend:

1. Conduct formal trademark search in relevant categories
2. Secure the shellgent.dev domain (or alternative preferred domain)
3. Register "shellgent" on relevant package registries (npm, cargo, etc.)
4. Create initial branding including logo and visual identity
5. Develop CLI command structure that works naturally with the name

## Conclusion

"Shellgent" represents the ideal balance of:
- Descriptive clarity (clearly communicates function)
- Distinctiveness (completely unique in software space)
- Usability (works well as CLI command)
- Memorability (intuitive combination of familiar terms)
- Availability (no conflicts found)

This name effectively communicates the essence of the multi-LLM console interface - an intelligent agent that operates in your shell environment, connecting you to multiple AI models through a simple, unified command-line interface.
