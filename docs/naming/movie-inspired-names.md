## Recommendation

Among these movie-inspired names, **WOPR** stands out as an exceptional choice:

1. It's short and easy to type as a command

5. It has no significant conflicts with existing software tools

The name works perfectly with your multi-LLM interface because:

Alternatives like **Morpheus** or **Gibson** would also work well if you prefer those references, but WOPR offers the perfect blend of brevity, recognition, and thematic relevance.
