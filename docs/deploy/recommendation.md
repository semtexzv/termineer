# AutoSWE Server Deployment Recommendation

After a thorough analysis of multiple cloud platforms, this document presents our final recommendation for deploying the AutoSWE server application. This recommendation is specifically tailored to the AutoSWE server's unique requirements, including OAuth authentication, payment processing, and database needs.

## Requirements Analysis

The AutoSWE server has several specific requirements that influence our deployment decision:

1. **Public-facing domain**: Required for OAuth callbacks with Google and Stripe webhooks
2. **PostgreSQL database**: Needed for storing user accounts, subscription data, and license information
3. **Rust application support**: The server is built in Rust and requires appropriate build/deployment capabilities
4. **WebSocket support**: For real-time features and efficient communication
5. **Reliability**: As a commercial service handling payments and user authentication, uptime is critical
6. **Reasonable cost**: As a new service, balancing performance with cost-effectiveness is important

## Platform Comparison Summary

| Platform | Monthly Cost | PostgreSQL | OAuth Support | Stripe Webhooks | Ease of Deployment | Global Coverage |
|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Fly.io | $54 | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Fully supported | ✅ Supported | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (30+ regions) |
| Render | $45 | ✅ Good | ✅ Fully supported | ✅ Supported | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ (Limited regions) |
| Digital Ocean | $54 | ✅ Good | ✅ Fully supported | ✅ Supported | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (14 regions) |
| AWS | $70-100 | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Fully supported | ✅ Supported | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (25+ regions) |
| Railway | $50-70 | ✅ Good | ✅ Fully supported | ✅ Supported | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ (Limited regions) |

## Primary Recommendation: Fly.io

**We recommend deploying the AutoSWE server on Fly.io for production use.**

### Rationale:

1. **Global Performance**: Fly.io's 30+ regions allow deploying the application close to users worldwide, minimizing latency for authentication and payment processes.

2. **PostgreSQL Support**: Fly.io offers solid PostgreSQL databases with all necessary features for the AutoSWE server's needs, including replication and backups.

3. **Rust Support**: Fly.io has excellent support for Rust applications with straightforward build processes.

4. **Webhook Reliability**: As a globally distributed platform, Fly.io ensures reliable webhook handling for Stripe payment processing.

5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: At approximately $54/month for a standard setup, Fly.io provides excellent value for the capabilities offered.

6. **WebSocket Support**: Fully supported with no limitations.

7. **Custom Domains**: Simple setup for the required custom domain with automatic SSL certificate management.

8. **No Cold Starts**: Unlike some platforms, Fly.io doesn't have cold starts that could affect authentication or payment processing.

### Recommended Configuration:

- **Computing Resources**: Dedicated instance with 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM ($39/month)
- **PostgreSQL Database**: 1GB RAM, 10GB storage ($15/month)
- **Deployment**: Direct from GitHub repository using GitHub Actions
- **Scaling**: Start with a single instance and enable horizontal scaling as user base grows

## Alternative Recommendation: Render

If global distribution is less important than absolute simplicity, **Render** offers the most straightforward deployment experience at a slightly lower cost ($45/month). It provides a simple user interface and streamlined workflow that could accelerate initial deployment.

**Render would be suitable if:**
- The majority of users are in North America or Europe
- Development speed and simplicity are prioritized over global performance
- The team prefers a more managed experience with less configuration

## Scaling Strategy

Regardless of the chosen platform, we recommend:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the recommended configuration for up to approximately 10,000 users.

2. **Monitor Key Metrics**:
   - Database connection count and query performance
   - API response times
   - CPU and memory utilization

3. **Staged Scaling**:
   - First increase vertical resources (more CPU/RAM)
   - Then implement horizontal scaling (more instances)
   - Finally, consider database read replicas if needed

4. **Cost Management**:
   - Set up budget alerts
   - Regularly review resource utilization
   - Consider reserved instances once usage patterns are established

## Implementation Plan

1. **Initial Setup** (1-2 days):
   - Create Fly.io account
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy initial application version

2. **Configuration** (1 day):
   - Set up custom domain
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Set up monitoring and alerts

3. **Testing** (2-3 days):
   - Verify OAuth flows
   - Test Stripe webhook integration
   - Perform load testing
   - Validate database performance

4. **Go Live** (1 day):
   - Final verification
   - Production deployment
   - Monitor initial user activity

## Conclusion

Fly.io provides the optimal balance of performance, reliability, global presence, and cost for the AutoSWE server's requirements. Its global edge network ensures fast response times for authentication and payment processing, while its PostgreSQL offering meets all database needs. The platform's reasonable cost and straightforward deployment process make it well-suited for a production SaaS application like AutoSWE.

By following the recommended configuration and implementation plan, the AutoSWE server can be deployed reliably and efficiently, providing a solid foundation for growth.
