## Introduction

This document focuses specifically on techniques to improve the output quality of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. While the [Advanced LLM Prompting Techniques](advanced-llm-prompting-techniques.md) and [Purpose-Specific Prompting Guide](purpose-specific-prompting-guide.md) cover general prompting strategies, this guide concentrates on methodically addressing quality concerns and implementing systems to ensure consistent, high-quality outputs from LLM agents.

## Common Output Quality Issues

### Hallucinations and Factual Inaccuracy

LLMs may generate content that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect or fabricated:

- Inventing non-existent information
- Making false attributions to sources
- Creating plausible-sounding but inaccurate explanations
- Confabulating details to fill knowledge gaps

### Inconsistency

Output quality may vary significantly between interactions:

- Contradicting previous statements within the same conversation
- Delivering different answers to the same question
- Inconsistent tone, style, or formatting
- Variable depth of analysis or detail

### Incompleteness

Responses may fail to fully address the query:

- Partial answers to multi-part questions
- Missing important aspects or considerations
- Insufficient depth for complex topics
- Truncated responses without proper conclusion

### Lack of Reasoning and Justification

Outputs may lack the necessary reasoning to support conclusions:

- Presenting conclusions without supporting evidence
- Insufficient explanation of the reasoning process
- Oversimplification of complex topics
- Failing to acknowledge uncertainties

### Prompt Misalignment

The model may misinterpret or partially address the prompt:

- Focusing on tangential aspects of the query
- Missing the implicit intent behind the question
- Overemphasizing one part of a multi-part request
- Failing to maintain the requested format or structure

## Quality Improvement Strategies

### Prompting Techniques for Quality Improvement

#### Self-Reflection and Evaluation

Implement reflection phases where the model critiques its own output:

```
[First generate response]

Now, critically evaluate the above response for:
1. Factual accuracy
2. Comprehensiveness
3. Logical coherence
4. Relevance to the original query
5. Potential biases or unwarranted assumptions

Based on this evaluation, provide an improved version of the response.
```

#### Multi-Draft Generation

Generate multiple drafts with progressive refinement:

```
Generate three different versions of a response to the following question, each using a different approach:
[Question]

First version: Focus on providing a concise, high-level answer
Second version: Focus on detailed explanation with examples
Third version: Focus on structured analysis with pros and cons

Now, synthesize these approaches into a final, optimal response that combines the strengths of each version.
```

#### Explicitly Structured Reasoning

Force structured decomposition of complex questions:

```
To answer the following question, please follow these steps:
1. Identify the key components of the question
2. List any assumptions that need to be made
3. Outline the information needed to provide a complete answer
4. Note any potential biases or limitations in your knowledge
5. Provide a step-by-step analysis
6. Summarize the final answer

Question: [Complex question]
```

### System-Level Improvements

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Incorporate external knowledge retrieval to ground responses in verifiable information:

1. Analyze the query to identify key information needs
2. Retrieve relevant information from trusted sources
3. Ground the model's generation in the retrieved information
4. Cite sources explicitly in the response

#### Feedback Loops and Iterative Refinement

Create systems that learn from evaluation and feedback:

1. Generate initial response
2. Evaluate quality using predefined criteria
3. Provide feedback on specific improvements needed
4. Generate refined response based on feedback
5. Repeat until quality thresholds are met

#### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Employ multiple specialized agents with distinct roles:

1. **Expert Agent**: Generates initial domain-specific content
2. **Critic Agent**: Evaluates for accuracy, completeness, and clarity
3. **Editor Agent**: Refines and improves based on critique
4. **Coordinator Agent**: Manages the workflow between agents

Example workflow prompt for a Critic Agent:
```
As a Critic Agent, your role is to evaluate the following response from an Expert Agent.

Original query: [Query]
Expert response: [Response]

Please evaluate this response on:
1. Factual accuracy (identify any questionable claims)
2. Completeness (identify missing information or perspectives)
3. Clarity and structure (identify confusing or poorly organized elements)
4. Alignment with the original query
5. Overall quality (rate from 1-10)

Provide specific, actionable feedback that the Editor Agent can use to improve the response.
```

### Content-Specific Quality Controls

#### Factual Content Verification

For informational or educational content:

1. Implement explicit fact-checking prompts
2. Request sources or justification for key claims
3. Use web search or knowledge base lookups for verification
4. Apply confidence ratings to different parts of the response

#### Creative Content Quality

For narrative or creative content:

1. Define clear evaluation criteria (coherence, originality, etc.)
2. Create rubrics for different creative formats
3. Implement style consistency checkers
4. Use comparative evaluation against exemplars

#### Technical Content Validation

For code, technical explanations, or analysis:

1. Implement logical validation checks
2. Test generated code against expected outputs
3. Verify mathematical or statistical calculations
4. Ensure technical accuracy of terminology and concepts

## Evaluation Frameworks

### Quality Metrics

Establish clear metrics to assess output quality:

1. **Factual Accuracy**: Correctness of information
2. **Relevance**: Alignment with user query
3. **Completeness**: Coverage of all aspects of the query
4. **Coherence**: Logical flow and consistency
5. **Clarity**: Understandability and organization
6. **Utility**: Practical value to the user
7. **Safety**: Freedom from harmful content

### Automated Evaluation Methods

#### LLM-as-Judge

Use separate LLM instances to evaluate outputs:

```
As an evaluation judge, assess the following response to a user query.

User query: [Original query]
Model response: [Response to evaluate]

Please evaluate this response on the following criteria:
1. Factual accuracy (1-5)
2. Completeness (1-5)
3. Clarity and organization (1-5)
4. Relevance to query (1-5)
5. Overall quality (1-5)

For each criterion, provide a score and brief justification. Then provide an overall assessment with specific recommendations for improvement.
```

#### Rubric-Based Scoring

Develop detailed rubrics for consistent evaluation:

| Criterion | 1 (Poor) | 3 (Adequate) | 5 (Excellent) |
|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Factual Accuracy | Contains multiple factual errors | Generally accurate with minor errors | Completely accurate with precise information |
| Completeness | Addresses <50% of query aspects | Addresses most key aspects | Comprehensively addresses all aspects |
| Clarity | Disorganized, confusing | Mostly clear with some structure | Exceptionally clear, well-organized |
| Relevance | Mostly off-topic | Mostly relevant with some tangents | Directly addresses the query |

#### Red-Teaming and Stress Testing

Proactively identify failure modes:

1. Develop challenging test cases targeting known weaknesses
2. Create adversarial queries designed to confuse the model
3. Test edge cases and unusual formats
4. Simulate different user behaviors and interaction patterns

### Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation

#### Quality Assurance Workflows

Implement human review processes:

1. Random sampling of outputs for human evaluation
2. Flagging system for uncertain or potentially problematic responses
3. Feedback collection from end-users
4. Domain expert review for specialized content

#### Calibrating Human and Automated Evaluation

Ensure consistency between human and automated judgments:

1. Have humans evaluate a subset of responses
2. Have automated systems evaluate the same subset
3. Compare results and identify discrepancies
4. Refine automated evaluation based on human judgments
5. Periodically repeat to maintain alignment

## Implementation Examples
