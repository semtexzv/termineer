## Introduction

This document summarizes advanced prompting techniques for Large Language Model (LLM) agents, highlighting strategies to improve output quality for different use cases. Whether you're building AI systems, using language models for specific tasks, or simply trying to get better results from conversational AI, these techniques will help you achieve higher quality outcomes.

## Fundamental Prompting Principles

### Core Elements of an Effective Prompt

Every well-structured prompt typically contains some combination of these elements:

1. **Instruction**: Clear directive telling the model what to do
2. **Context**: Background information that guides the response
3. **Input Data**: Specific question or data requiring a response
4. **Output Indicator**: Format specification for the desired output

### Basic Prompting Best Practices

- **Start simple and iterate**: Begin with basic prompts and refine based on results
- **Be specific and detailed**: The more descriptive your prompt, the better the results
- **Use clear formatting**: Separate sections with markers like "###" or line breaks
- **Focus on what to do**: Tell the model what you want rather than what you don't want
- **Maintain clarity**: Direct instructions outperform clever but vague prompts

### Example of a Well-Structured Basic Prompt

```
### Instruction ###
Classify the sentiment of the following customer review as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Input ###
The product arrived on time, but the packaging was damaged. The item itself works as expected.

### Output Format ###
Sentiment: [classification]
Reasoning: [brief explanation]
```

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

A technique that enhances reasoning by breaking problems into intermediate steps.

#### How It Works
- Guides the model through a step-by-step reasoning process
- Can be implemented through examples (few-shot) or simple triggers (zero-shot)
- Significantly improves performance on math, logic, and complex reasoning tasks

#### Example
```
Question: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, then buys 3 more and eats 1, how many apples does John have?

Thinking step by step:
1. John starts with 5 apples
2. John gives 2 apples to Mary, so he has 5-2=3 apples
3. John buys 3 more apples, so he has 3+3=6 apples
4. John eats 1 apple, so he has 6-1=5 apples
Therefore, John has 5 apples.
```

#### Variants
- **Zero-shot CoT**: Simply adding "Let's think step by step" to prompts
- **Auto-CoT**: Automatically generating reasoning chains for demonstration

### ReAct Framework (Reasoning + Acting)

A framework that combines reasoning with the ability to take actions when external information is needed.

#### Key Components
- **Thought**: Reasoning traces for planning and tracking
- **Action**: Interface with external tools or knowledge bases
- **Observation**: Process information from external sources

#### Example
```
Question: What was the population of Berlin in 2020 divided by the population of Paris in the same year?

Thought: I need to find the population of Berlin in 2020 and the population of Paris in 2020, then divide them.
Action: Search[population of Berlin 2020]
Observation: According to statistics, Berlin had a population of approximately 3.66 million in 2020.
Thought: Now I need the population of Paris in 2020.
Action: Search[population of Paris 2020]
Observation: Paris had a population of approximately 2.16 million in 2020.
Thought: Now I can calculate the ratio. 3.66 million รท 2.16 million
Action: Calculate[3.66/2.16]
Observation: 1.694444444
Therefore, the population of Berlin was approximately 1.69 times that of Paris in 2020.
```

### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

An extension of CoT that explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously with backtracking capabilities.

#### Key Features
- Maintains a tree of potential solution paths
- Uses search algorithms (BFS/DFS) to explore systematically
- Allows self-evaluation of intermediate steps
- Particularly effective for complex problems with multiple approaches

#### Simple Implementation
```
Imagine three different experts solving this problem:
All experts will write down one step of their thinking, then share it with the group.
Then all experts will proceed to the next step.
If an expert realizes they're wrong, they will drop out.

The problem is: [complex problem description]
```

## Improving Output Quality

### Structured Reasoning Strategies
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Use for complex tasks requiring logical steps
- **ReAct**: Implement when external knowledge or tools are needed
- **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**: Apply for problems with multiple possible solution paths

### Self-Evaluation and Reflection
- Add reflection steps where the model critiques its own output
- Implement verification checks for factual accuracy
- Use a multi-draft approach (generate, then refine)

#### Example Reflection Prompt
```
Before providing your final answer, please review your response for:
1. Factual accuracy and potential hallucinations
2. Logical coherence and reasoning validity
3. Completeness in addressing all aspects of the question
4. Relevance to the original query

Revise your answer if needed based on this self-evaluation.
```

### External Knowledge Integration
- Use ReAct to interface with knowledge bases
- Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground responses
- Allow models to explicitly state uncertainty and knowledge gaps

### Multiple Agent Approaches
- Use "panel" approaches with multiple perspectives
- Implement specialized roles for different aspects of a problem
- Have one agent evaluate another's output for quality control

## Purpose-Specific Prompting

### For Analysis and Problem-Solving
- Use structured reasoning with explicit steps
- Request explicit justification for each conclusion
- Define clear evaluation criteria

#### Example
```
Analyze the following business scenario and recommend a solution:
[scenario description]

Please structure your response as follows:
1. Key issues identified (with evidence)
2. Potential approaches (minimum 3)
3. Evaluation of each approach (pros/cons)
4. Recommended solution with implementation steps
5. Potential challenges and mitigations
```

### For Creative Generation
- Provide inspiration without over-constraining
- Set clear parameters within which creativity should operate
- Use specific examples of the desired style/tone

#### Example
```
Write a short story about [topic] that incorporates:
- A surprising plot twist
- Vivid sensory descriptions
- Themes of [specific theme]
- Between 400-600 words

The style should be similar to [author/example], prioritizing emotional impact while maintaining narrative coherence.
```

### For Information Extraction and Summarization
- Be explicit about information categories needed
- Specify output format (bullet points, tables, etc.)
- Set criteria for inclusion/exclusion of details

#### Example
```
Extract the key information from this research paper:
[paper text]

Format your response as:
- Research question/objective (1-2 sentences)
- Methodology summary (3-4 bullet points)
- Key findings (up to 5 bullet points)
- Limitations acknowledged (2-3 points)
- Practical implications (2-3 points)
```

### For Decision Support
- Use ToT to explore decision branches
- Request explicit criteria-based evaluation
- Ask for confidence levels and risk assessment

## Implementation Best Practices

### Model Selection Considerations
- More capable models (GPT-4, Claude 3) respond better to advanced prompting
- Smaller models may need more explicit instructions and examples
- Task complexity should match model capabilities

### Parameter Settings
- **Temperature**: Higher (0.7-1.0) for creative tasks, lower (0-0.3) for factual/analytical tasks
- **Max tokens**: Set appropriately to allow complete responses
- **Top-p/Top-k**: Adjust based on desired output diversity

### Evaluation and Iteration
- Test prompts with varied inputs to ensure robustness
- Collect and analyze failure cases
- Iteratively refine based on output quality
- Consider using LLM-as-judge for systematic evaluation
