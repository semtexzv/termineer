# Shell Execution Flow from Claude's Perspective

## Command Initiation
1. I analyze the user's request to run `test_interrupt.sh`
2. I formulate the shell command in the required format
3. I send this command to the AutoSWE console interface

## Command Execution
4. The tool system recognizes this as a shell command
5. The system executes the script in a subprocess
6. As output is generated, it's streamed to me in real-time
7. I begin receiving and processing the output lines

## Output Processing
8. I see each line as it's produced (Starting test script, Line 1, Line 2, etc.)
9. The script continues executing with its 1-second delays between operations
10. I'm passively receiving this information without taking action

## Interruption Process
11. As the script reaches line 9, the system determines enough output has been gathered
12. The system automatically interrupts the running process
13. The system sends an interruption notification: "[COMMAND WAS INTERRUPTED: The LLM determined it had sufficient information]"
14. From my perspective, the command execution simply terminates with this message
15. I can no longer receive additional output from the terminated command

## After Interruption
16. I analyze the received output up to the interruption point
17. I formulate my response based on the partial execution
18. I acknowledge the interruption occurred in my response to the user
19. I can continue with the conversation where we left off

## Technical Observation
I don't have visibility into how the interruption decision is made. The AutoSWE interface likely uses one or more of:
- Output volume threshold
- Execution time limits
- Pattern recognition in the output
- Manual interruption from the user

The interruption appears to happen automatically without any action from me as the LLM.
