# MCP tool output is not grayed out.

# LLM backend timeout and retry.
- We should run the backend API calls with a really long timeout, let's say 100 to 200 seconds.
- For example, when we receive a network issue, we should utilize a linear back-off with a maximum waiting time of 30 seconds.
- Maybe use a library timeout to detect network issues.

# Bugs:
- Wrapping logic is not correct in the input box, multiline text the cursor is one character behind per line

# Asynchronous shell.
Allow running commands asynchronously, their new output being periodically injected into the conversation. Agent
should be able to start a shell, then would receive the output periodically, and then can kill the shell.
 Would allow us testing the application itself better.

# Tool input rewrites
Tool should be able to clean up its own invocation, rewrite it to be shorter, parse ambiguous syntax and replace it with
structured one.

# GUI - custom
Use bevy to create a simple GUI.
- Should use the same backend as TUI

# Autoinclude & project info are sent using UserInput, should be marked as not coming from user.
- Something like renaming the variant as Input, and then having flag to mark input from user vs the orchestrator
- field named Source, and enum InputSource.

# Modify system template generation so that the first user query can be included.
# Lazily generate system prompt when first query arrives
