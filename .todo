# LLM backend timeout and retry.
- We should run the backend API calls with a really long timeout, let's say 100 to 200 seconds.
- For example, when we receive a network issue, we should utilize a linear back-off with a maximum waiting time of 30 seconds.
- Maybe use a library timeout to detect network issues.

# Simple Sessions.
- Whenever user is working in the directory save the session periodically or after every model output to a file
- This file should be called .session.

# Bugs:
- Wrapping logic is not correct in the input box, multiline text the cursor is one character behind per line
- Tools template needs to specify that write tool will overwrite entire file contents
- --help doesnt show list-tools.
