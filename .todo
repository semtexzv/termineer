# LLM backend timeout and retry.
- We should run the backend API calls with a really long timeout, let's say 100 to 200 seconds.
- For example, when we receive a network issue, we should utilize a linear back-off with a maximum waiting time of 30 seconds.
- Maybe use a library timeout to detect network issues.

# Simple Sessions.
- Whenever user is working in the directory save the session periodically or after every model output to a file
- This file should be called .session.

# small things.
- Remove serde_element_array file because there is a copy of it now in serde_utils.
