# LLM backend timeout and retry.
- We should run the backend API calls with a really long timeout, let's say 100 to 200 seconds.
- For example, when we receive a network issue, we should utilize a linear back-off with a maximum waiting time of 30 seconds.
- Maybe use a library timeout to detect network issues.

# Simple Sessions.
- Whenever user is working in the directory save the session periodically or after every model output to a file
- This file should be called .session.

# Name change
- If we're going public, we have to come up with a name: what about Termineer - Terminal Engineer
- Invoked by `termineer --model=claude-3.7`

# Generate the kind list during compiletime
- Generate rust file containing obfstr constant of the bundled prompts

# Bugs:
- Remove internal logging (Eg interruption except when the interrupt is occuring), ad bdevprintln that will only be compiled in in debug mode
- Wrapping logic is not correct in the input box, multiline text the cursor is one character behind per line
- Tools template needs to specify that write will overwrite entire file contents
