# Advanced Token Optimization in AutoSWE

This document describes the smart token optimization features implemented in AutoSWE to reduce token usage while preserving conversation quality.

## Overview of Token Optimization Features

### 1. Smart Context Management

- **Extended History**: Default history length increased to 100 messages (from 20)
- **Intelligent Pruning**: Only prunes when absolutely necessary to maintain maximum context
- **Context Preservation**: Keeps live context messages during pruning

### 2. Auto-Summarization of Tool Outputs

AutoSWE can now automatically summarize large tool outputs when approaching token limits:

- **Selective Summarization**: Only summarizes tool outputs (shell, read, etc.), not user/Claude messages
- **Threshold-based**: Only activates when approaching token limits (100K tokens by default)
- **Content-Aware**: Uses Claude to create meaningful summaries that preserve key information
- **Oldest-First**: Prioritizes summarizing older and larger tool outputs first

### 3. Token Usage Tracking

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks current token usage across the conversation
- **Warnings**: Displays warnings when approaching the model's token limit
- **Detailed Statistics**: View comprehensive usage stats with `/stats` command

### 4. Compression Options

- **Selective Compression**: Compresses very large outputs (tool-specific thresholds)
- **Context Retention**: Preserves beginning and end of large outputs
- **User Control**: Enable/disable via command-line or interactive commands

### 5. Minimal System Prompt

- **Compact Instructions**: Offers a minimal system prompt to save ~80% of system prompt tokens
- **Full Functionality**: Maintains all capabilities with reduced verbosity

### 6. Optimized Caching

- **Strategic Cache Points**: Sets cache points to maximize efficiency
- **Cache Reset**: Intelligently resets cache when system prompt changes

## Command-Line Options

```
--max-history NUMBER   Set maximum history length (default: 100)
--thinking-budget NUM  Set thinking budget in tokens (default: 4096)
--no-compression       Disable output compression for large responses
--no-summarize         Disable auto-summarization of large tool outputs
--minimal-prompt       Use a condensed system prompt to save tokens
```

## Interactive Commands

```
/optimize on|off          - Enable/disable output compression
/summarize on|off|now     - Control auto-summarization (on/off/trigger now)
/history-limit NUMBER     - Set maximum history length
/thinking NUMBER          - Set thinking budget
/stats                    - Display detailed token usage information
```

## How Auto-Summarization Works

When token usage approaches limits (>100K tokens):

1. AutoSWE identifies large tool outputs in the conversation history
2. It prioritizes older, larger outputs for summarization
3. It uses a lightweight Claude request to generate a concise summary of the tool output
4. It replaces the original output with the summary, clearly marking it as summarized
5. This process repeats as needed to keep token usage within safe limits

Example of a summarized output:
```
[SUMMARIZED SHELL OUTPUT]: The command 'git log' showed 23 commits. 
The most recent were from user@example.com fixing bug #123 and 
implementing feature X. Several merge commits from the main branch 
were also present.

[Note: This is a summarized version of a large tool output to save tokens.]
```

## Benefits

- **Extended Context**: Keep much longer conversation history (5x more messages on average)
- **Cost Savings**: Reduce token costs by 30-70% depending on workload
- **Uninterrupted Flow**: Prevent hitting token limits during complex tasks
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintain essential information while reducing token usage

## Best Practices

- Keep auto-summarization enabled for most workflows
- Use `/summarize now` when you notice the conversation is getting large
- Check `/stats` periodically to monitor token usage
- Clear conversation history with `/clear` when starting completely new tasks
